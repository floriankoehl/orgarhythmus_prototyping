# Architecture

FastAPI + SQLite backend (`main.py`) + Vite/React frontend (`src/`), both on localhost.

---

## Backend

**Startup:** `_init_db()` creates tables → `_migrate()` adds missing columns → `_seed_defaults()` inserts default project/dimensions. All automatic, runs every restart.

**Project scoping:** `notes`, `dimensions`, `saved_filters`, and perspectives have `project_id` directly. `categories`, `milestones`, `dependencies`, `deadlines` don't — they're reached via subqueries (e.g. `WHERE note_id IN (SELECT id FROM notes WHERE project_id = ?)`).

**Transaction system (most important part):** Schedule writes go through `POST /transactions` with a `before` + `after` snapshot. Backend validates:
1. Current DB matches `before` (optimistic locking — catches stale edits)
2. `after` state passes all schedule rules (no overlaps, no passing milestones, deadline enforcement, dependency constraints, no cycles)

If both pass → apply atomically + push to undo stack. Otherwise → reject, nothing written.

**Row converters:** Every table has a `_xxx(row)` helper that converts sqlite rows to camelCase JSON for the API response. The only place database naming leaks into the API contract.

## Frontend

**`api.js`:** Module-level `_projectId` gets appended to every `api.*` call. `setProjectId(id)` switches projects — no props need to change. `projectsApi` bypasses this for global endpoints (list projects, export).

**`App.jsx`:** Two screens: `home` (project list) or `workspace` (four views). State: `view` (0–3), `activeProject`, `notes`. All four views are always mounted — `display: flex | none` to switch. This keeps Classification and Schedule state alive when navigating away.

**Views:**
- `0` — ProjectDashboard: metadata, stats, export
- `1` — BrainstormV2: note capture
- `2` — ClassificationPage: dimensions, categories, filters, perspectives
- `3` — SchedulePage: Gantt, transactions, undo/redo, warning system

**SchedulePage key ideas:**
- Column indices only — `metric` controls what columns are labeled (days/weeks/months/hours), not what's stored
- Refs (`scrollLeftRef`, `spacingRef`, `milestonesRef`) for RAF callbacks to avoid stale closures
- `buildRowItems()` produces flat row model: lane headers, note rows, gaps
- Conflict reveal: when a transaction violates constraints, temporarily unhides the conflicting notes, blinks milestones, then restores prior view state

**Perspectives:** JSON blobs stored in the database. Frontend owns the structure — backend just stores/retrieves. Captured: spacing, grouping, hidden lanes, scroll position, filters, color settings.
